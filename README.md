# LoanDefaulterDashboard
🚀 Excited to share a new Power BI project I’ve been working on!
I recently completed a Loan Default Customer Analysis report as part of my ongoing work in data analytics. 📊
This end-to-end report was built using:
✔️ Power Query – for data cleansing and transformation
 ✔️ Data Modeling – creating relationships and calculated measures
 ✔️ Interactive Visualizations – to uncover key insights on loan default trends
 ✔️ Scheduled Refresh – to ensure up-to-date data insights
 ✔️ Published to Power BI Service & Dataflows – for sharing and collaboration
Special thanks to my manager 
Sharda Mandal II Ankit Sabharwal II Aman Pratap Singh II 
and team for their support and feedback throughout this project. 🙌
🔗 This dashboard helps stakeholders quickly identify risk factors and make informed lending decisions.
